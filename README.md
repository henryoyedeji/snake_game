# snake_game
Here is a simple and very basic snake game deloveloped using python3 object oriented programming and turtle module.

To play the game, simply run main.py on any python IDE.

The snake game works like the usual snake games where you have to avoid the borders and keep your focus on the food. 
The more food the sanke eats, the longer the snake grows.
